## Is JSX mandatory for React?
   Yes, JSX is not mandatory for using React. Actually it is convenient when you donâ€™t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).

 For example, let us take a greeting example with JSX,

 class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello {this.props.message}</div>;
    }
    }

 ReactDOM.render(<Greeting message="World" />, document.getElementById('root'));

 You can write the same code without JSX as below,

 class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return React.createElement('div', null, `Hello ${this.props.message}`);
    }
    }

  ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Greeting, { message: 'World' }, null),
    document.getElementById('root'),
    );

## Is ES6 mandatory for React?

   ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015, is not mandatory for React development, but it is highly recommended. React itself does not require ES6, but many of its features and the ecosystem around it heavily rely on ES6 syntax and features.

## What is Virtual DOM?

 The Virtual DOM is a concept used in React and other modern JavaScript frameworks to improve performance and efficiency when updating the user interface (UI). 
   It's a lightweight copy of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) that exists in memory and is used by React to perform updates in a more efficient way.

   Initial Render:
         When a React component is first rendered, it creates a Virtual DOM representation of the UI.

   Changes and Updates: 
         When the state or props of a component change, React creates a new Virtual DOM representation of the updated UI.

   Diffing Algorithm:
       React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called "diffing". It identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two 
      Virtual DOMs.

   Minimal Updates:
         React then applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM to reflect the updated UI. This process is more efficient than directly manipulating the 
        entire DOM, as only the changed elements are updated.

  Batching Updates:
        React may also batch multiple updates together to further optimize performance, reducing the number of times the actual DOM is updated.

## What is Reconciliation in React?
   
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM to reflect changes in the application's state or props. When a component's state or props change, React needs to determine which parts of the DOM need to be updated to reflect those changes. Reconciliation is the algorithm that React uses to efficiently update the DOM.

   Here's how reconciliation works in React:

   Render Phase: 
              When a component's state or props change, React re-renders the component and generates a new Virtual DOM tree.

  Diffing Algorithm:
             React then compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using a process called "diffing". It identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two Virtual DOM trees.

  Minimal Updates:
              React then applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM to reflect the updated UI. This process is more efficient than directly manipulating the entire DOM, as only the changed elements are updated.

 Batching Updates:
             React may also batch multiple updates together to further optimize performance, reducing the number of times the actual DOM is updated.

  Reconciliation is a key part of React's performance optimization strategy. By using a Virtual DOM and a diffing algorithm, React minimizes the number of expensive DOM operations (such as reflows and repaints) and improves the overall performance of the application.

## What is React Fiber?

  React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm, designed to improve the performance and responsiveness of React applications. It was introduced in React version 16 and is a complete rewrite of the previous reconciliation algorithm.

  The key features and improvements introduced by React Fiber include:

 Incremental Rendering:
     React Fiber enables incremental rendering, which means that the rendering work can be split into smaller chunks and spread out over 
     multiple frames. This allows React to prioritize rendering and updating the most important parts of the UI first, improving perceived performance and 
     responsiveness.

 Improved Scheduling: 
        React Fiber introduces a new scheduling algorithm that allows React to better manage and prioritize updates. It can pause and resume work as needed, 
      ensuring that the UI remains responsive even when performing expensive computations or rendering large amounts of data.

 Better Error Handling: 
               React Fiber improves error handling by providing better stack traces and error boundaries. This makes it easier to identify and debug 
               errors in React applications.

Better Support for Asynchronous Updates:
          React Fiber provides better support for asynchronous updates, allowing React to handle asynchronous data fetching and other asynchronous operations more 
          efficiently.

 Improved Support for Suspense and Lazy Loading: 
              React Fiber provides better support for Suspense and lazy loading, allowing React to suspend rendering and display loading indicators while waiting 
              for data or other resources to become available.

 Improved Support for Concurrent Mode: 
        React Fiber provides better support for Concurrent Mode, which allows React to perform multiple updates concurrently without blocking the main thread. 
       This improves the overall performance and responsiveness of React applications.

## Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
  In React, the key prop is used to identify elements in the Virtual DOM and to help React efficiently update the DOM when the component's state or props change. The key prop is not required for all components, but it is important in certain situations, particularly when rendering lists of items or when reordering elements.

  Rendering Lists: 
    When rendering a list of elements, each element should have a unique key prop. This helps React identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed, and ensures that the DOM is updated correctly.
      function MyComponent() {
        const items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

 return (
            <ul>
            {items.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{item}</li>
            ))}
            </ul>
        );
        }
 Reordering Elements:
     When reordering elements in a list, the key prop helps React identify which elements have moved and update the DOM accordingly. Without key, React may mistakenly reuse elements in the wrong order.

   function MyComponent() {
        const items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

  return (
            <ul>
            {items.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
            ))}
            </ul>
        );
        }

 Dynamic Lists: 
   When adding or removing items from a list dynamically, the key prop helps React keep track of which elements have changed and update the DOM efficiently.

   function MyComponent() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']);

   const addItem = () => {
            setItems([...items, 'date']);
        };

 return (
            <div>
            <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
            <ul>
                {items.map((item, index) => (
                <li key={index}>{item}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
            </div>
        );
        }


In summary,
    the key prop is important in React when rendering lists of items, reordering elements, or dynamically adding or removing items from a list. It helps React efficiently update the DOM and maintain a consistent UI.


## Can we use index as keys in React?
  Yes, 
    you can use the array index as keys in React, but it's generally not recommended, especially when rendering dynamic lists or when the list items can be reordered or filtered.

 Using the array index as keys can lead to several issues:

 Stability: The array index is not stable and can change when items are added or removed from the list. This can cause React to incorrectly reuse elements or lose track of which elements have changed.

 Performance: Using the array index as keys can lead to poor performance, especially when the list is long or when items are frequently added or removed. React needs to re-render the entire list when the index keys change, which can be inefficient.

 Reordering: When items are reordered, the array index keys can change, leading to incorrect rendering or loss of state.

   Instead of using the array index as keys, it's recommended to use a unique identifier for each item, such as an ID or a combination of properties that uniquely identify the item. This ensures that the keys are stable and unique, making it easier for React to efficiently update the DOM and maintain a consistent UI.

    function MyComponent() {
           const items = [
                { id: 1, name: 'apple' },
                    { id: 2, name: 'banana' },
                    { id: 3, name: 'cherry' },
                ];

                return (
                    <ul>
                    {items.map((item) => (
                        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
                    ))}
                    </ul>
                );
                }

## What is props in React? Ways to
  Props, 
    short for properties, are a way to pass data from parent to child components in React. They are a fundamental concept in React and are used to make components more reusable and flexible.

   Passing Props: Props are passed from parent components to child components as attributes. For example:

   function ParentComponent() {
            return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
            }

 function ChildComponent(props) {
            return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
            }
In this example, the name prop is passed from the ParentComponent to the ChildComponent as an attribute.

Receiving Props: 
   In the child component, props are received as an object. You can access the props using dot notation (props.name) or destructuring (const { name } = props;). For example:


 function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
        }
Default Props:
    You can define default values for props using the defaultProps object. If a prop is not passed from the parent component, the default value will be used. For example:


 function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
        }

  ChildComponent.defaultProps = {
        name: 'Guest',
        };
Props Validation: 
     You can define the types of props using the propTypes object. This helps catch errors and ensure that the correct data types are passed to the component. For example:
        import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

 function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
        }

 ChildComponent.propTypes = {
            name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
            };
Passing Functions as Props:
     You can also pass functions as props from parent to child components. This allows child components to communicate with parent components. For example:


 function ParentComponent() {
        const handleClick = () => {
            alert('Button clicked!');
        };

 return <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />;
        }

 function ChildComponent(props) {
        return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click me</button>;
        }
Passing Props to JSX Elements:
    You can also pass props to JSX elements directly. For example:

 function ParentComponent() {
        return (
            <div>
            <ChildComponent name="John" />
            <ChildComponent name="Jane" />
            </div>
        );
        }


## What is a Config Driven UI ?
   A Config-Driven UI, also known as a Configuration-Driven UI, is a user interface that is designed to be highly configurable and customizable through a configuration or settings file. This approach allows developers to define the structure and behavior of the UI using a set of rules or parameters, rather than hardcoding specific elements or behaviors.

Here are some key characteristics of a Config-Driven UI:

  Dynamic Content:
            A Config-Driven UI can dynamically generate content based on the configuration provided. This means that the UI can adapt and change based on different configurations, allowing for greater flexibility and customization.

 Reusable Components:
            Config-Driven UIs often use reusable components that can be configured with different settings or properties. This allows for greater code reuse and modularity.

 Separation of Concerns:
            By separating the configuration from the UI logic, a Config-Driven UI can be easier to maintain and update. Changes to the UI can be made by updating the configuration file, rather than modifying the code directly.

Adaptive Layouts: 
           A Config-Driven UI can adapt its layout and structure based on the configuration provided. This allows for responsive and adaptive designs that can work across different devices and screen sizes.

        Customizable Behaviors:
             Config-Driven UIs can define custom behaviors and interactions based on the configuration provided. This allows for greater control over the user experience and can help tailor the UI to specific use cases or requirements.
